# Running scripts

The scripts are captured from an interactive Sympy session.

To run them, first install [Sympy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).  Create
a virtual environment and activate it (example uses Python 3)

    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate

Download Sympy source from [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/releases).
Unzip it and then from within it run

    python setup.py install

Now you can run `isympy`.  Use `%load`, etc. to load these scripts and execute
them.
